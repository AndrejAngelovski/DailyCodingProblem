# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

# This problem was asked by Google.

# UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.

# For example, the Euro sign, â‚¬, corresponds to the three bytes 11100010 10000010 10101100. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

# For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
# For an n-byte character, the first byte starts with n ones and a zero. The other n - 1 bytes all start with 10.
# Visually, this can be represented as follows.

#  Bytes   |           Byte format
# -----------------------------------------------
#    1     | 0xxxxxxx
#    2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
#    3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
#    4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
# Write a program that takes in an array of integers representing byte values, and returns whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.
